# Event-Calendar
React based event planeer / calendar

This is a WIP project. The API I use is running into a cors error so disable cors in your browser before running the app. For google chrome in windows type in the following in cmd:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security --disable-gpu --user-data-dir=~/chromeTemp
```
This issue can be solved by using a proxy server which I am currently working on.

To run the app clone the repo and run ```npm run start``` in home folder.
